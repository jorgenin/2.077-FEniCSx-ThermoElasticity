# Finite thermo-elasticity FEniCS codes
A collection of FEniCS finite element codes for problems in finite thermo-elasticity.

Constructed by Lallit Anand (anand@mit.edu) and Eric M. Stewart (ericstew@mit.edu).

Updated for FEniCSx by Jorge Nin (jorgenin@mit.edu)

## Running the codes

We recommend running the FEniCS codes locally and using ParaView to visualize the results.

Alternatively, you can run any FEniCS *.py code hosted publicly on GitHub by following the instructions in this Google Colab web notebook:
